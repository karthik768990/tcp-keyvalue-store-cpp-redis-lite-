# üöÄ C++ Key-Value Store (Redis-Inspired TCP Project)

This project is a **custom-built, minimal Redis-like key-value database system** implemented in modern C++. It includes a robust TCP server and a feature-rich client with custom protocol support, connection management, and local command history.

Designed to mimic the behavior of Redis using raw sockets and binary protocol encoding, it's a great learning resource for understanding:

- Sockets (TCP/IP)
- Custom binary protocol design
- Event-driven client-server communication
- Memory-safe and low-level systems programming in C++
- Efficient maintainance of the idle connections
- Data structures
- Manual memory management

## ‚ú® Features

### üñ• Server
- Accepts multiple client connections
- Parses custom binary protocol
- Supports TTL-based expiration
- Automatically removes idle connections
- Handles ZSET (sorted set) operations

### üßë‚Äçüíª Client
- Command-line interface
- Automatic reconnection handling
- 10-second socket timeout with robust error handling
- Maintains local history of last 10 commands
- 'hist' command to display recent commands with timestamps
- Graceful exit on entering 'quit'

### ‚öôÔ∏è Protocol
- Fully custom binary message framing
- Efficient type-tagged responses (nil, string, integer, float, array, error)
-Efficient responses given by the server in the binary format which is universally accepted that are 1 as success and 0 as failure

| 'QUIT'                       | Exit the client gracefully                   |
| 'PEXPIRE <key> milli sec'    | Set key to expire in N milliseconds          |
|'TTL key'                     | Get the remaining time to live in seconds    |
|'PTTL key'                    | Get the remaining time to live in milli sec  |
| 'KEYS'                       | Returns all the keys                         |

> ‚úÖ All commands except 'HIST' are sent to the server using a binary protocol.

## üîß Build Instructions

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- A Linux-based system or WSL
- 'g++' with C++17 or newer
- Basic familiarity with terminal usage

### üî® Compile

'''bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o server server.cpp
g++ -std=c++17 -o client client.cpp
## Usage 
- Clone the repository from the terminal of ubuntu based kernels using
 git clone https://github.com/karthik768990/tcp-keyvalue-store-ccp-redis-lite.git
-Then navigate to the folder using
 cd tcp-keyvalue-store-ccp-redis-lite
-Compile both the server and the client codes using the commands mentions above and then run the cliend and the server separately in two separate terminals using
./server
./client
-Use the terminals input as the input of the commands from the client side and go with it and use the server.
